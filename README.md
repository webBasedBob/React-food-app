# Introduction

A(nother) food delivery app, where users can buy shawarma and watch Youtube videos during delivery and 
afterwards. The app uses a series of APIs, like Google Maps API to embed a map in the app, convert coordinates to addresses 
and search for restaurants near a point on the map; Youtube Data v3 API to search for content and embed a Youtube player 
inside the app.

# Tech Stack
